[Efficient rhythms]({{ page.external_url }}) is a Python tool for musical composition. In short, it generates loops, and then transforms them according to a chord progression. There are many parameters that control the nature of the loop and the chord progression. The [documentation]({{ page.docs_url }}), though still very much a work-in-progress, has an [accessible introduction]({{ page.docs_url }}#how-it-works) with many musical examples.

Here's an example of the results:
