[music_df](https://github.com/malcolmsailor/music_df) is a package providing functions for reading various formats (e.g., MIDI, musicxml, humdrum) into Pandas dataframes and then transforming, augmenting, or otherwise processing the result. I developed it in the course of my dissertation. Documentation can be found [here](https://music-df.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
