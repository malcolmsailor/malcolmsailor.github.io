[`dumb_composer`](https://github.com/malcolmsailor/dumb_composer) is a Python program that takes a Roman numeral analysis as input and outputs synthetic Classical music. I hoped to improve my Roman numeral analysis models with this synthetic data but didn't actually use it for that purpose. Nevertheless, it's a fun project. I've written a little more about it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/02/21/dumb-composer.html).
