Charles Koechlin was a contemporary of Debussy and Ravel's and a student of Fauré's. His music was wonderful (e.g., his [piano quintet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5fj6g7FQBk)) but he was also a voluminous writer on music theory. I have translated some of the most interesting excerpts from his mammoth treatise on harmony. They should be of interest to anyone interested in impressionist and extended tonal harmonies.
