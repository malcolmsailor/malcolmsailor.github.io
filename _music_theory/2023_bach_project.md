title: "The Beginning of the Middle: Initiation and Reinitiation in Bach’s Binary-form Keyboard Works"
subheading: Music Theory and Analysis (MTA) Volume 10.2 (Forthcoming).
year: 2023
abstract: "This article borrows from William Caplin’s theory of formal functions, adapting these borrowings to music from Bach’s keyboard dance suites. It begins with a description of how Caplinian phrase functions, like “initiation” and “continuation,” can be applied in this music. It then describes “reinitiation” function, a phrase function that Bach uses following non-final cadences. Reinitiation is similar to Caplin’s initiating phrase functions, with the crucial difference that it occurs in an unstable harmonic context. This combination of harmonic instability with otherwise initiating features allows reinitiation to succinctly express both a local “beginning” and a higher-level “middle.” Bach most often achieves the harmonic instability characteristic of reinitiation function by means of a technique this article calls “de-tonicization”: the immediate tonal destabilization of a point of cadential arrival by reinterpreting it as a non-tonic harmony in some other key."
