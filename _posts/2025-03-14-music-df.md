title: "`music_df`: a library for working with musical scores as Pandas dataframes"

In the course of my dissertation research, I developed a Python library for working with musical scores as Pandas dataframes, which I call `music_df`. You can find it on GitHub at [https://github.com/malcolmsailor/music_df](https://github.com/malcolmsailor/music_df). With this library, you can among many other things:

- read from a variety of formats, including MIDI, Humdrum, MusicXML, and others.
- postprocess the scores in various ways, such as salami-slicing, quantizing, dedoubling and de-tremoloing them.
- apply augmentations like transposition (which can be sensitive to pitch-spelling) or time-scaling (which adjusts the time signatures appropriately).
- plot dataframes as piano-rolls or display them as scores, displaying annotations or coloring noteheads.

Everything is in a tabular format convenient for machine learning and other data science applications. Documentation is a work in progress, but can be found at [https://music-df.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://music-df.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
