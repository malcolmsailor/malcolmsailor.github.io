This year, with the kind assistance of the Canada Council for the Arts, the intrepid cellist [Sahara von Hattenberger](https://www.saharavon.com/) commissioned me to write a piece for her upcoming album. The ensemble was a fun challenge: cello with jazz rhythm section (piano, bass and drums). The album will be released soon on [Odd Sound](https://www.oddsoundmusique.com/), but my piece is now available as a single on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5PL1DjUZ75u1dDc1B39Edh), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/night-path-ep/1766813699), and other streaming platforms.
