I recently had an idea for how to build intuition for different values of entropy: a guessing game, in which you are given a target entropy value, and you respond with a distribution. Your goal is for the entropy of your distribution to come as close as possible to matching the target.

As an exercise in learning React, I recently implemented this idea, and you'll find it just below.
