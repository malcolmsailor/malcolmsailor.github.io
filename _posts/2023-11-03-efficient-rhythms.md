At the Composition Interest Group meeting at the 2022 conference of the Society for Music Theory, I presented an original work created with my program [Efficient Rhythms](https://malcolmsailor.com/efficient_rhythms/). I also created an annotated animation of the work, which attempts to illustrate the various procedures taking place:
