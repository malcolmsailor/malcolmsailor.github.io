title: My Bach article in *Music Theory Analysis*
date: 2024-03-20
---

I'm happy to announce that a paper I began during my Master's degree, "The Beginning of the Middle: Initiation and Reinitiation in Bachâ€™s Binary-form Keyboard Works," has been published in the journal *Music Theory and Analysis*. (The pace of publication in small humanities fields like music theory can be glacial, although I must own that in this case I am not entirely blameless if this article took a long time to come out.) This is a work of good old-fashioned music theory where I investigate Bach's use of form in his keyboard suites, music that has played a long and important role in my life.
